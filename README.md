# SiteDemoOne

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## Project

For this project I used greensock libray to facilitate the animation.

## How does it work

The up/down arrows will change the image and also transition the background along with it.

The color pickers will also do the same type of transition aforementioned.

The button "Shop Now", will create a beautiful animation on all the elements
